    <h1>Vanilla Latte</h1>

    <p>My favorite type of drink would have to be different types of coffee. For specific coffee drinks, I would say my favorite to be an iced vanilla latte using oat milk and sugar free vanilla syrup. 
        I make this drink at home all the time and almost always have one in the morning before starting my day. </p>
